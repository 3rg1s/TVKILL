#TV KILL - Universal IR-Remote

**TV KILL** is a mobile application for Android that enables you to turn-off TVs, using your device's built-in IR-blaster.  
The app basicly transmits a variety of off-patterns for different TVs successively, which will cause most TVs to power down.

**TV KILL** is available on Google Play and F-Droid
